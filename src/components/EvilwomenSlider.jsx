    name: 'Elizabeth BÃ¡thory',
    nickname: 'The Blood Countess',
    image: '/eliz.jpeg',
    description: `Elizabeth BÃ¡thory was a Hungarian noblewoman accused of torturing and killing hundreds of young girls during the late 1500s. She reportedly believed that bathing in their blood would keep her young â€” a wild tale that earned her the nickname "The Blood Countess." Though some historians argue the story was exaggerated by political enemies, her legacy as one of historyâ€™s scariest noblewomen remains intact. She was eventually confined to her castle until her death.`

  {
    name: 'Ilse Koch',
    nickname: 'The Witch of Buchenwald',
    image: '/koch.jpeg',
    description: `Ilse Koch, the wife of a Nazi concentration camp commandant, became notorious for her extreme cruelty during WWII. She was known for her obsession with tattoos and allegedly selected prisoners based on them. Stories say she had lampshades made of human skin, though this was never definitively proven. After the war, she was tried and convicted. Whether myth or reality, her name became symbolic of monstrous power in the hands of someone unhinged.`
  },
  {
    name: 'Jiang Qing',
    nickname: 'Madame Mao',
    image: '/qing.jpeg',
    description: `Once an actress, Jiang Qing rose to political power as Mao Zedongâ€™s wife. She became a major force during Chinaâ€™s Cultural Revolution, orchestrating purges and silencing opposition in the arts, education, and government. Her leadership style was theatrical, dramatic, and ruthless â€” blending propaganda with punishment. After Maoâ€™s death, she was arrested and labeled a major culprit behind the revolutionâ€™s darkest periods.`
  },
  {
    name: 'Myra Hindley',
    nickname: 'The Moors Murderer',
    image: '/myra.jpeg',
    description: `In the 1960s, Myra Hindley shocked the UK with her involvement in a series of horrifying murders committed alongside her partner Ian Brady. What made it even more unsettling was her seemingly ordinary appearance and calm demeanor. She became a symbol of how evil can wear a mask of innocence. Hindley was arrested, tried, and spent the rest of her life in prison.`

  {
    name: 'Belle Gunness',
    nickname: 'Hellâ€™s Belle',
    image: '/belle.jpeg',
    description: `Belle Gunness was an American serial killer who lured wealthy bachelors to her Indiana farm with marriage ads â€” then murdered them for their money. Dozens of bodies were eventually found buried on her land. One day, her house mysteriously burned down and she vanished. Itâ€™s unclear whether she died in the fire or faked her death, but either way, she left behind one of the eeriest unsolved mysteries in American crime history.`
